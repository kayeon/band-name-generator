CHECK LIST 3.2


Finally, complete your app:

X    Move the verb object to a module
X    Move the noun object to a module
X    Move the postWord function to a module
X    In server.js, add a post route for verbs
X    In server.js, add a post route for nouns
X    In index.html, add 2 more input fields to the form, one for verbs, and one for nouns.

?    In script.js, add an if block to the submitWords event listener to post verbs to /verbs
?    In script.js, add an if block to the submitWords event listener to post nouns to /nouns

    In index.html, display the response from the verbs post
    In index.html, display the response from the nouns post

    All in all, a random band name should be generated with the click of a button, selected from user-entered verbs, nouns, and adjectives.

    Now add another feature of your choosing to the app. Quotes? Tracking whether words have been used, with a reset button? Remembering a list of starred/favorited names? It's up to you! Here are the requirements for this new feature:

    Be triggered by an event on the front end (on load, focus, click, etc.)

    Make an ajax call to the back end

    Hit a new route (get or post) that you create

    Render that response

    Make sure that any logic (functions, objects, etc.) associated with your new route are in their own lib file, and required in to the server.js file.

    Be sure to commit all changes, and re-deploy to Heroku after you've made all your changes.
